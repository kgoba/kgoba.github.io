    <h1>Monolithic Crystal Filter matching</h1>

    <p>To match an MCF to a specific source/load impedance, the following needs to be done:
        <ol>
            <li>Find out the termination load of the MCF from the datasheet.</li>
            <li>Convert the termination load to resistance and reactance (complex impedance).</li>
            <li>Design a matching network.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Termination load</h2>

    <p>MCFs need to be terminated with a proper load to work correctly. 
        MCF datasheets usually specify the termination load as resistance parallel to capacitance (R || C). This needs to be converted to series form R_t + jX_t. It can be done by hand (very cumbersome), or 
        there are <a href="https://daycounter.com/Calculators/Parallel-Series-Impedance-Conversion-Calculator.phtml">online calculators</a> that can do it. 
        Just make sure to specify the working frequency of the MCF.</p>

    <p>For example, the datasheet says termination load 1000 ohm || 5 pF. Thus an ideally terminated MCF would look so:</p>
    <img src="png/mcf_1.png"/>

    <p>At 45 MHz this means a 1000 ohm resistance in parallel with a -1j/(2pi*45MHz*5pF) = -707j ohm reactance. 
    Using parallel circuit formula Z = Z_1*Z_2 / (Z_1+Z_2), the termination impedance is Z = 1000*(-707j)/(1000-707j) = 333 - 471j.</p>
    
    <h2>Source and load impedance</h2>

    <p>MCFs are symmetric (input and output can be exchanged with no difference theoretically), which means that on both input and output it should "see" the termination load:
        <ul>
        <li>On the <em>output side</em> the load should be equal to the termination load.</li>
        <li>On the <em>input side</em> the source impedance should also be equal to the termination load in order to have a correct impedance match.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>This means our example can be represented like this:</p>    
    <img src="png/mcf_2.png"/>

    <h2>Matching network design</h2>

    <p><a href="https://home.sandiego.edu/~ekim/e194rfs01/jwmatcher/matcher2.html">LC matching network designer</a></p>

    <p>The devil is in the details. The specified termination load (and thus the impedance that MCF presents to our matching network) refers only to the passband. 
        Outside the passband, impedance can change very wildly. 
        The matching network will transform it to some other impedance, and here the choice of one or another matching network might make a difference.</p>

    <p>To continue our example, our signal source has now 333-471j ohms source impedance, which means that the input impedance of our MCF is 333+471j - note the change of sign in reactance (this follows from matching theorem).
        To match this with a 50 ohm signal source, we can use a matching network designer with source impedance of 50 ohms and load impedance of 333+471j ohms. 
        If our expected load is also 50 ohms, we can reuse the same matching network in reverse (symmetric to input).
        Here we choose a simple first order lowpass matching network since for most cases lowpass behaviour is the better option:</p>

    <h2>Higher order MCFs</h2>

    <p>Typically a single MCF is a second order filter. However, two MCFs can be chained together to obtain a fourth order filter with steeper bandpass response. 
        Sometimes MCFs are sold in pairs of two with the intention to combine them into a fourth order MCF.
        The output of one MCF can be connected to the input of another MCF with a small coupling capacitor to the ground. The value of this capacitor is specified in the datasheet.</p>
    <img src="png/mcf_5.png"/>

    <p>The nice news is that the input/output impedance of such combined filter will still be the same as in the original case, so the same calculations apply.
        The chain can be continued for more identical MCFs the same way.</p>

    <h2>Direct connection to amplifiers</h2>

    <p>The MCF can be put between two amplifiers with a known input/output impedance by using same matching technique described above. 
        However, in some cases it's possible to simplify the schematic even more. 
        For example:

    </p>
    
    <img src="png/mcf_4.png"/>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>On the input side use a common gate or common source JFET amplifier and use the load resistor R1 and coupling capacitor C1 (plus the drain capacitance of JFET) to define the terminating impedance for our MCF.</li>
            <li>On the output side use a common source or common drain JFET amplifier and load the MCF with a resistor R2 and capacitor C2 (plus the gate capacitance of JFET).</li>
        </ul>
        Here L1 is an RF choke with a very high impedance at working frequency.
